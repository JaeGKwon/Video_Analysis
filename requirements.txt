✅ Here’s the updated `requirements.txt` for this project:

```
streamlit
pillow
torch
transformers
ffmpeg-python
```

**What’s new or important:**
- `streamlit`: runs the app
- `pillow`: handles image loading and manipulation (PIL)
- `torch`: backend required for transformers
- `transformers`: needed for CLIP model
- `ffmpeg-python`: optional, but can help manage ffmpeg calls in Python if you later switch from subprocess

Remember, you still need to install the actual `ffmpeg` binary separately — it’s **not a Python library** and must be on your system PATH.
